<p align="center">Sample Android project utilizing the developer API from the National Park Service</p>

### Getting Started
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the ```gradlew build``` command or use ```Import Project``` in Android Studio.

To run tests, run ```gradlew test```

### Prerequisites

### Installation
Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/drewstephensdesigns/ParkExplorer.git
   ```

### Purpose
Allows users to view a list of parks by varying topics.  Currently defaults to ```Laborer and Worker```.  [FloatingActionButton](https://developer.android.com/reference/com/google/android/material/floatingactionbutton/FloatingActionButton) allows the user to select a different park topic.  The JSON response is then returned with National Park Service properties matching the criteria.  For the purpose of this app, only the first 40 topics are shown.  The user can click on a park detail: this will open a web browser to the corresponding park page of the National Park Service.
